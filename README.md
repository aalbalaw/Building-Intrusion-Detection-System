# Building-Intrusion-Detection-System
Building Intrusion Detection System for Network Security Using the KD99 Data Set
This code was written for the using jupyter notebook. The code is to build two different IDS mdels. 
The first one is for an IDS that is able to distinguish between different major attacks. 
The second IDS is able to distinguish between normal connection and attacks. The data set i used in this code is the KDD99 data set which is available for public use at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
Three algorithms i used using the Sklearn library; SVM, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.
